    <p>I <em>LOVE</em> Bob's Burgers! I feel like keeping the child in you alive starts with cartoons. I really like how
        Bob's Burgers stays kid friendly enough for children to watch and not catch on to the adult content in the
        cartoon. It really achieves the fun and entertaining concept that every cartoon should have. When thinking of a
        passion, essentially, people like to think of what is something they love to do. For me, a passion can come in
        the form of anything, like cartoons. Being passionate about the Bob's Burgers cartoon is how I feel when I talk
        about it or how I feel when I watch it. I get thrilled being able to share my happiness of the show with the
        people around me.</p>

    <p>My mom started off my love for this cartoon. She showed it to me and I was <strong>IMMEDIATELY</strong> hooked!
        My love for the cartoon soon turned into me going to look for graphic tees and the socks to go with it. Then all
        of that turned into me making a cool website out of the one thing I get excited about. The cartoon fits in with
        my outgoing and bubbly personality because the characters are so fun and silly. <em>(Like me of course!)</em> I
        continue to be inspired to do creative and fun things after I get done watching the show. This show honestly
        makes me want a burger every time I watch it, lol.</p>

    <h4><strong>What does Bob's Burgers mean to me?</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>It represents the idea of spontaneous events. Nothing in the show ever goes as planned.</li>
        <li>Bob's Burgers is very uplifting. Whenever thier friends or family are upset, despite their differences, they always come around and uplift each other.</li>
        <li>Louise Belcher is the brains of the children. She's constantly getting into trouble by using her smarts and techniques.</li>
        <li>Gene Belcher is more of the silly one. He looks at life as if it's just one big joke. He never likes to take things too seriously because then life wouldn't be as fun.</li>
        <li>Tina Belcher is an outcast. She's not like the other kids. She's tries to stay out of the way of trouble and she's always trying to be cool by being like everyone else.</li>
        </ul>
