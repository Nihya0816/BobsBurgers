    <h2>Bob's Burgers</h2>
    <p>I <em>LOVE</em> Bob's Burgers! I feel like keeping the child in you alive starts with cartoons. I really like how Bob's Burgers stays kid friendly enough for children to watch and not catch on to the adult content in the cartoon. It really achieves the fun and entertaining concept that every cartoon should have. When thinking of a passion, essentially, people like to think of what is something they love to do. For me, a passion can come in the form of anything, like cartoons. Being passionate about the Bob's Burgers cartoon is how I feel when I talk about it or how I feel when I watch it. I get thrilled being able to share my happiness of the show with the people around me.</p>

    <p>My mom started off my love for this cartoon. She showed it to me and I was <strong>IMMEDIATELY</strong> hooked! My love for the cartoon soon turned into me going to look for graphic tees and the socks to go with it. Then all of that turned into me making a cool website out of the one thing I get excited about. The cartoon fits in with my outgoing and bubbly personality because the characters are so fun and silly. <em>(Like me of course!)</em> I continue to be inspired to do creative and fun things after I get done watching the show. This show honestly makes me want a burger every time I watch it, lol.</p>
