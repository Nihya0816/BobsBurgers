    <h1>3 Opinions I Have About Bob's Burgers</h1>

    <p>Everybody has different opinions about the silly adult cartoon, Bob's Burgers. My purpose for even adding the
      fact
      that these are <strong>MY</strong> opinions is the fact that so many people get "cancelled" everyday because of
      something they said or sometimes fans like to call out the fact that what a person says isn't a factual statement.
      Getting cancelled for wrong information and having an opinion is stupid to me but I mean I guess that's a part of
      life in today's society.</p><br>

    <h3>1. It's family-friendly</h3>
    <p>Unlike all the other adult cartoons out there, Bob's Burgers is a show equally enjoyed by all ages. Most adult
      jokes that are made are in phrases that most younger children would fail to understand. The vibrant colors and
      interesting weird sounds are both entertaining to the eyes and ears which makes it difficult for children not to
      watch it. Throughout the series, the characters sing plenty of different songs they've made up. Most children are
      very talkative and will sing about basically anything which makes the show even more appealing to a younger
      audience.</p>

    <h3>2. You can learn from it</h3>
    <p>Of course, all cartoons have they're funny moments and you never really take anything they say seriously. In
      Bob's Burgers, the spontaneous life of the kids (Louise, Gene, and Tina) can really help you learn life lessons.
      Evey time they argue, someone always apologizes in the end because they realize that what they did was wrong. It
      helps the audience to understand that you won't always be right about everything in life. Sometimes apologies are
      definitely needed and can benefit you in the end. Outside of learning from the kids, you can also learn from Bob
      and Linda. Sometimes even they act sort of childish. Quarreling with each other about little stupid things, being
      irresponsible while doing the simplest tasks, and maybe even not being harsh enough on their kids. There's always
      a good life lesson to learn from each and every one of the characters. </p><br>

    <h3>3. All of the characters are relatable</h3>
    <p>Every character in Bob's Burgers has their own unique personality. Louise is the trouble maker, Gene is the
      oppposite of the brains (if you get what I mean), Tina is the boy crazy, worrisome teen, Linda is the outgoing
      one, and Bob is the complainer. Everyone shares their own role in the show which adds a lot more entertainment.
      Some episodes are based off of the character themself. Sometimes when you think you can only relate to one
      character, you end up relating to all of them in some weird messed up way.</p><br>
